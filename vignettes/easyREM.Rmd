# Relative Elevation Models

Relative Elevation Models (REM) are a way to visualize and expose differences of elevation for a particular region of interest (ROI) and highlight patterns regarding land surface.

REMs are used as a methodology to delineate Planning-Level Channel Migration Zones, proposed by Washington State Department of Ecology that regulate development within these areas on shoreline streams.

This notebook aims to help everyone interest in hydrology, water and urban management.

## Libraries and dependencies

First we install the easyREM library hosted on GitHub

```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("emanuel-gf/easyREM")
library(easyREM)
```

## Creating Boundaries (bbox)

To delimitate the boundaries of the region of interest (ROI) I used the ArcGIS web map to look at the USGS tiles and its covering regions stored on the web-service.

The points represents the left-down and right-up corners of the ROI.

```{r}
##Set boundaries of the bbox
xmin <- -93.382
ymin <- 34.2653
xmax <- -93.361
ymax <- 34.275

## Set CRS
crs <- 4326  ##WGS84

### Creating the BBox
bbox <- create_bbox(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax,crs=crs)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Visualizing the bbox
mapview::mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE, georaster = FALSE)
mapview::mapview(bbox,alpha=0.1,map.types ='Esri.WorldImagery')
```

## DEM Data

### USGS DEM

The USGS web service provides an easy way to download its data via API. The terrainR library does a magnificent job of utilizing this service.

Download the files from the USGS service.

***Disclaimer*****:** Try to reduce the size of your area of interest. REMs are more visually pleasing for smaller areas of interest. Additionally, depending on the size of the ROI, it may take a while to download and process.

```{r}
library(progressr)
handlers("progress")
with_progress(
dem <- terrainr::get_tiles(
    data = bbox,
    output_prefix = "rem",
    side_length = NULL,
    resolution = 2, #meters
    services = "elevation",
    verbose = TRUE
    )
)

sprintf('The DEM tiles are compose by %s tile(s)',length(dem$elevation))
```

From the USGS service, each tile has a size of approximately 8km.

Sometimes, the ROI is covered by more than one tile, making it necessary to composite a mosaic of the tiles for proper handling. To properly mosaic, some attributes need to be considered, such as matching the spatial resolution and CRS. The function present in the *easyREM* package deals with merging objects.

For the purpose of this tutorial, the chosen ROI only requires one tile and does not need merging.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
##Converting to terra objects
## In case the bbox have only one tile.
if (length(dem$elevation)==1) {
  dem_rast <- terra::rast(dem$elevation)
  # dem_rast <- terra::rast("rem_3DEPElevation_1_1.tif")
} else {
  ## For more than one tile is necessary to create a composition
  dem_rast <- process_dem_tiles(dem,verbose=TRUE)
  
  ### Merge the raster
  dem_mosaic <- terra::merge(dem_rast[[1]],dem_rast[[2]],dem_rast[[3]],
                              #dem_rast[[4]],#dem_rast[[5]],dem_rast[[6]],
                              filename='merged.tif',
                              overwrite=TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
### In case you have already downloaded the tiles
#dem <- c()
#dem$elevation <- list.files(
#  "your_path",
#  pattern = "\\.tif",
#  recursive=FALSE
#)
```

## River Line

In order to create REM objects, the centerline of river channels are needed. Rivers data can be retrieved in many ways, the following process exemplifies how do it with:

-   OSM DATA
-   HydroSheeds

### OSM Data - Rivers

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Retrieve OSM Data
river <- osmdata::opq(
    bbox = sf::st_bbox(bbox)
) |>
    osmdata::add_osm_feature(
        key = "waterway",
        value = "river"
    ) |>
  osmdata::osmdata_sf() ##Simple feature objects 

river_sf <- river$osm_lines |> ## Intersect the bbox
    sf::st_intersection(
        bbox
    ) |>
    sf::st_union() |>
    sf::st_cast(
        "LINESTRING"
    ) |>
  sf::st_as_sf()

```

Visualize the river shapefile retrieved from OSM

```{r plot_osm_river_1, echo=FALSE}
##Visualize the river 
terra::plot(dem_rast)  
plot(
    sf::st_geometry(
        river_sf
    ),
    col = "white",
    add = TRUE
)
```

### HydroSheed

Another way to retrieve a rivers shapefile is through the [HydroSheeds](https://www.hydrosheds.org) project. To facilitate the process, *easyREM* contains a function that downloads it to your current folder as a .shp file. The function requires a region that is sourced from the HydroSheeds region mapping, which includes Global and regions such as Africa, South America, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, and North America.

To determine where your region of interest is located according to the atlas provided by the HydroSheeds project, a function is called to check it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
easyREM::determine_hydrosheeds_region(sf::st_bbox(bbox)["xmin"],sf::st_bbox(bbox)["ymin"])
```

So, the correct HydroSheed Rivers dataset is downloaded.

The glossary of HydroRivers is:

-   sa = South America

-   ar = Artic

-   as = Asia

-   eu = Europe and Middle East

-   au = Australasia

-   na = North America

-   af = Africa

To download all the respectivelly shapefiles from the HydroSheeds project,another function in *easyREM* function deals with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rivers_ar <- download_hydrorivers("na")

print(rivers_ar)
```

Filter only where the boundary box intersects the Rivers geofiles.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rivers_intersect <- st_intersecting_river(rivers_ar,bbox)
```

Plot the WaterSheeds Rivers to compare with others Datasets.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
terra::plot(dem_rast)  
plot(
    sf::st_geometry(
        rivers_intersect
    ),
    col = "white",
    add = TRUE
)
```

Due to the fact that the HydroSheeds project is generated by the USGS DEM-30 meters, the rivers are delineated by accumulation flow algorithms. For higher spatial resolution, the river line does not accurately match the exact center of the river.

To address this situation as accurately as possible, it is possible to create the river centerline using several methods and approaches proposed by remote sensing imagery.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to use OSM data because it matches well enough.

## Extract Values

Extracting elevation values is a strategy for populating points that matches the river shapefile with elevation from the DEM raster. It is a crucial step to develop the REM model.

Depending on your computational capacity, resampling the raster to a coarser resolution is needed.

```{r eval=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
## Resampling the raster in case your laptop can not process. 
#dem_rast_agg <- terra::aggregate(
#    dem_rast,
#    fact = 2
#)

river_elev <- terra::extract(
    x = dem_rast,
    y = terra::vect(river_sf),
    xy = TRUE,
    na.rm = TRUE
) |>
    na.omit()

names(river_elev)[2] <- "elevation" #Rename the column to elevation
print(c(nrow(river_elev),'elevation points were extracted'))
```

## Interpolation

### IDW - Inverse Distance Weighting

Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is a widely used spatial technique in the geospatial field. IDW considers that closer points are more heavily weighted than relatively distant points. Points that are further away receive less weight in predicting a value at a location. The Washington Department of Ecology used IDW for delineating the Bottom Valley Channel (BVC), and its studies can be found here: <https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/publications/documents/1406025.pdf>

In order to apply the method on R, the package *gstat* is called and creates the IDW interpolation.

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Create IDW model
idw_model <- gstat::gstat(
  formula = elevation ~ 1,
  locations = ~x + y,
  data = river_elev,
  nmax = nrow(river_elev)
)

## Predict Values by Interpolating 
river_surface <- terra::interpolate(
  dem_rast,
  idw_model,
  crs=terra::crs(dem_rast)
)
```

## Relative Elevation Model

The relative elevation model is nothing more than the subtraction of the river interpolation raster by the digital elevation model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Creates the REM
rem <- dem_rast - river_surface

# Resample
rem_final <- terra::resample(
    rem, dem_rast
)
```

## Visualize

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rem_df <- as.data.frame(
    rem_final,
    xy = TRUE
)

head(rem_df)

names(rem_df)[3] <- "elevation"
```

Computes elevation's logarithms.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

epsilon <- 1e-10

rem_df$elevation_log <- log1p(
    pmax(
        rem_df$elevation, epsilon
    )
)

breaks <- classInt::classIntervals(
    rem_df$elevation_log,
    n = 12,
    style = "fisher",
    largeN=TRUE,
    samp_prop = 0.1
)$brks
```

Create the pallette

```{r, eval = FALSE}
### Let`s make a quick plot to visualize the REM

#Create a pallette 
cols <- hcl.colors(
    palette = "vik",
    12, rev = TRUE
)
#Vis
pie(rep(
    1, length(cols)
), col = cols)

# SELECT THE PALLETTE
pal <- cols[c(1, 2:12)]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Theme
theme_for_vis <- function() {
    theme_minimal() +
        theme(
            axis.line = element_blank(),
            axis.title.x = element_blank(),
            axis.title.y = element_blank(),
            axis.text.x = element_blank(),
            axis.text.y = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
            legend.position = "right",  
            legend.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 1),
            legend.key.height = unit(1.5, "cm"),
            legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),
            plot.background = element_rect(
                fill = "white", color = NA
            ),
            plot.margin = unit(
                c(
                    t = 0, r = 0.5, 
                    l = 0, b = 0
                ), "cm"
            )
        )
}
```

Plot

```{r,cache=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
rem_plot <- ggplot(
    rem_df, aes(
        x = x, y = y,
        fill = elevation_log
    )
) +
    geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_gradientn(
        breaks = breaks,
        colours = pal,
        name = "Elevation (m)",
        # Transform back using expm1() which is the inverse of log1p()
        labels = sprintf("%.2f", expm1(breaks))  # Using %.0f to round to whole numbers
    ) +
   labs(title = "Relative Elevation Models") +  
    theme_for_vis()

rem_plot
```

Easily creating a contour line for the REM mode

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Contour Line
contour_line <- terra::contour(rem_final)
```
